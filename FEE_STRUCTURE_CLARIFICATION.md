# CreatorApp Fee Structure

## Overview

CreatorApp operates on a transparent, creator-friendly pricing model. We don't take a cut of your success.

## What You Pay

### 1. Platform Subscription (to CreatorApp)

You pay a monthly subscription to use the CreatorApp platform:

- **Starter Plan**: $19/month (14-day free trial)
- **Pro Plan**: $49/month (14-day free trial)
- **Enterprise Plan**: $99/month (14-day free trial)

**This is your only cost to CreatorApp.**

### 2. Stripe Transaction Fees (to Stripe, not CreatorApp)

When you sell products to your customers, Stripe (the payment processor) charges standard fees:

- **US**: 2.9% + $0.30 per successful transaction
- **International**: Varies by country (typically 2.9% + $0.30 or similar)
- **Currency conversion**: Additional 1% if applicable

**These fees go directly to Stripe, not CreatorApp.**

---

## What You DON'T Pay

### ❌ No Platform Fees

- **No transaction fees to CreatorApp**: We don't take a percentage of your sales
- **No revenue sharing**: You keep 100% of your revenue (minus Stripe's fees)
- **No additional processing fees**: Only standard Stripe fees apply
- **No hidden charges**: What you see is what you pay

### ❌ No Usage Limits

- **Unlimited courses**: Create as many as you want
- **Unlimited students**: No caps on enrollments
- **Unlimited pages**: Build as much content as needed
- **Unlimited email sends**: Based on your plan limits

## Example Calculation

### Scenario: You sell a $100 course

```
Sale Price:                 $100.00
Stripe Fee (2.9% + $0.30):  -$3.20
Your Payout:                $96.80

CreatorApp Platform Fee:    $0.00 ✅
```

You receive $96.80, and Stripe keeps $3.20 for processing the payment.

### 3. Transparent Pricing

No hidden fees, no surprises. Just your monthly subscription plus standard Stripe fees.
