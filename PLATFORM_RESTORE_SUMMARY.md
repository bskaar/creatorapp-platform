## Site Branding

- **Site Name**: CreatorApp
- **Tagline**: "All-in-One Creator Platform"

## What This Means

**CreatorApp Platform** = The multi-tenant SaaS software (like Kajabi/Teachable) that:
- Creators sign up for to build their business
- Provides website builder, course hosting, email marketing, etc.
- Charges monthly subscription fees ($79-$299/month)

**NOT a course** - It's the platform that enables creators to sell their own courses.

## Future Options

If you want to offer the AI Prototyping course later:
1. You could restore the content from `AI_PROTOTYPING_BACKUP.json`
2. Create it as a separate site/subdomain
3. Or offer it as a product within the CreatorApp ecosystem
